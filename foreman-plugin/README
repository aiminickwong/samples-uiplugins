NOTE THAT THIS PLUGIN IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED AND TESTED.

There is a built-in integration in oVirt now.

=================================================================================================================================================================

In the oVirt engine, take the files Foreman UI plugin files from the UI-plugins repository, and place them in /usr/share/ovirt-engine/ui-plugins:
1. foreman.json
2. foreman-files/start.html

Set up Apache mod_proxy in the oVirt-engine server as follows (change names and ports according to your environment), adding the following to /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf, in the <IfModule mod_proxy.c> section (note that if you already have oVirt proxy defined in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ovirt-engine.conf then just add it the foreman definitions below):
ProxyPassMatch ^/(foreman)(/.*)?$ http://foreman_server:foreman_port/$1$2
ProxyPassReverse /foreman http://foreman_server:foreman_port/foreman
ProxyPass /webadmin http://engine-server:engine-port/webadmin
ProxyPassReverse /webadmin http://engine-server:engine-port/webadmin
ProxyPass /api http://engine-server:engine-port/api
ProxyPassReverse /api http://engine-server:engine-port/api
Restart the oVirt engine, and Apache
Access webadmin through the URL you put in httpd.conf
Now you can enjoy the Dashboard, and VM-Foreman sub-tabs in case the VM is found in Foreman (via uuid or name)

Change the Foreman URL in the foreman.json file, to contain the URL to your oVirt engine, followed by /foreman:

        "url": "http://engine-severport/foreman",
        "loginUrl": "http://engine-server:port/foreman/users/login",
        "logoutUrl": "http://engine-server:port/foreman/users/logout",
 
To configure the SSL proxy you'd need mod_ssl configured, adding/changing the following entries in the relevant VirtualHost section in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf:

SSLEngine on
SSLProxyEngine on
ProxyPassMatch ^/(foreman)(/.*)?$ https://foreman_server:foreman_port/$1$2
ProxyPass /webadmin https://engine-server:engine-port/webadmin
ProxyPassReverse /webadmin https://engine-server:engine-port/webadmin
ProxyPassReverse /foreman https://foreman_server:foreman_port/foreman
SSLProxyMachineCertificateFile path_to_cert.pem
The PEM file above is created by concatenating the certificate file (path defined in the SSLCertificateFile entry), and the key file (SSLCertificateKeyFile entry).
